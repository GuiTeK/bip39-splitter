Usage: %s split [-l <language>] [-p <parts>] [-t <threshold>] | combine [-l <language>] | [-h | -help]
Version: %s

bip39-splitter allows to split (and reconstruct) a BIP-39 mnemonic (also known as "seed phrase") using Shamir Secret
Sharing method.

Commands:
    split   Splits a mnemonic (seed phrase) into multiple parts
    combine Combines back parts into the original mnemonic (seed phrase)

Parameters:
    <language>: language of the BIP-39 mnemonic (seed phrase). One of:
        %s
    <parts>: number of parts to split the mnemonic (seed phrase) into
    <threshold>: number of parts required to reconstruct the mnemonic (seed phrase) with command 'combine'

IMPORTANT: the Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) implementation can be considered secure as it was copied as-is from Hashicorp
Vault at https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/v1.19.0/shamir/shamir.go, however because all implementations of SSS
tend to be slightly different (plus the fact that we add extra steps besides SSS), this software is not compatible with
other SSS implementations such as the 'sss' tool on Linux. This means YOU NEED TO KEEP A COPY OF THIS PROGRAM TO
RECONSTRUCT YOUR MNEMONIC IN THE FUTURE.
